# Website for Volta Greentech
During the summer of 2019 I built the first website for Volta Greentech, a startup battling global warming by reducing methane emissions from cows. This website turned out very slow and not very scalable for future development. Therefore, I rebuilt it during the summer of 2021. See the new and improved version [here](https://github.com/johan-akerman/VoltaGreentech). <br />

## ⚙️ Technologies used
Used html, css, javascript, jquery, bootstrap and chart.js. 
You can see the website live over at www.voltagreentech.com
